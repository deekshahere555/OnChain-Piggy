### 1. Connect Wallet
- Click "Connect MetaMask" 
- Ensure you're on Flow Testnet
- The app will automatically prompt you to switch networks if needed

### 2. Deposit FLOW
- Enter the amount of FLOW you want to deposit
- Set the lock duration in seconds (minimum 60 seconds)
- Click "Deposit FLOW"
- Confirm the transaction in MetaMask

### 3. Deposit ERC-20 Tokens
- Enter the token contract address
- Specify the amount to deposit
- Set the lock duration
- Click "Approve & Deposit" (requires two transactions)

## üîß Technical Details

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 with custom animations
- **Blockchain:** Flow EVM testnet integration
- **Wallet:** MetaMask compatibility
- **Smart Contract:** Solidity timelock contract with reentrancy protection

## üì± Smart Contract

The dApp interacts with a deployed smart contract on Flow testnet:

- **Contract Address:** `0xaf54BEf4a78B675AF51A14FdB346b98FbD3Fdc3b`
- **Features:** ETH/ERC-20 deposits, timelock mechanism, batch withdrawals
- **Security:** Reentrancy protection, proper access controls

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Wrong Network" Error**
   - Ensure MetaMask is connected to Flow Testnet (Chain ID: 420)
   - Use the "Switch to Flow Testnet" button

2. **"Could not decode result data" Error**
   - This usually means no deposits exist yet
   - The app handles this gracefully and shows an empty state

3. **Transaction Fails**
   - Check if you have sufficient FLOW for gas fees
   - Ensure the contract address is correct
   - Verify you're on the correct network

### Debug Mode

Open browser console to see detailed error messages and transaction logs.
